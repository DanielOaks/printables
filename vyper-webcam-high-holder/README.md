# anycubic vyper webcam holder

This attaches to the Anycubic Vyper's x-axis rail and has a space for a 1/4 inch screw (like used on the Logitech C922 webcam) :)

- Based on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4942227 from Teenietuss (the `Kamerahalter_Vyper.stl` file is from here)
- Inspired by https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5025365 from k1ff

If you don't have a 1/4 inch screw, use this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:578514 from AxxAxx. It's amazing! The stl file is included in this folder as `CAM_screw.stl`
